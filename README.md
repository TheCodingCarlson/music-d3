# Last FM D3

### Basic Info
A small project I made to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of [D3JS](https://d3js.org/) and SVG. I used the [Last FM API](http://www.last.fm/api) to obtain the data for my charts and graphs. There are three sections to this project. The first allows you to search bands/artists and then renders a dynamic SVG bar graph of the 10 most popular albums for that artist by play count. The second section renders a bubble chart of the top 10 most popular artists/bands currently being streamed on Last FM. The third section shows a pie chart of the top 10 most played songs on the site. Enjoy!
